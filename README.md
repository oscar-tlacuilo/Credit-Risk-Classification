# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the risk of defaulting on loans based on several financial metrics. By assessing this model, we aim to provide insights that can help the company in making informed lending decisions.

## Results
- **Accuracy Score**: 0.99
- **Precision Score**: 
  - Healthy loan (0): 1.00
  - High-risk loan (1): 0.85
- **Recall Score**: 
  - Healthy loan (0): 0.99
  - High-risk loan (1): 0.94

## Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrated excellent ability to predict healthy loans (0) and a good ability to predict high-risk loans (1). The precision, recall, and f1-score for the healthy loan class were higher than those for the high-risk loan class, indicating a better performance for healthy loan predictions.

Based on these results, I recommend using this model with confidence for predicting healthy loans. However, while the model performs well in predicting high-risk loans, there is still room for improvement. Further tuning or incorporating additional data might enhance the modelâ€™s ability to identify high-risk loans more accurately. Implementing additional models or combining this model with other techniques could also improve the overall predictive accuracy for high-risk loans.
